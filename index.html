                        This website will provide help and support for your modification of your Chromebook. 
                        It should be fun and simple, you can search for a modification/post from the search
                        bar above on the navigation bar. This site is regularly updated, as you can tell on the posts,
                        as we add new ones each time we can.
                        <br/><br/><br/>
                        From this website, as you can tell, you support modifications to allow you to do stuff that
                        you usually cannot. For example enter the BIOS of a Chromebook, or enable RW_Legacy to
                        dual boot into other Live operating systems (using media drives, of course) or maybe drivers
                        to fix audio from the Live booting. It's a whole heck of a fun journey. To support this website, you
                        <!-- could donate to us or --> can subscribe to the YouTube channels [of the developers] in the about page.
