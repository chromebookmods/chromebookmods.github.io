                <h4>
                    Let's see. ChromeOS is a bit of a dandy Operating System, especially if you were very used to Windows 10.
                    Let's turn your dreams into reality and make your Chromebook into a Windows machine. Before you do so,
                    special attributes towards <a href="https://mrchromebox.tech/">MrChromebox</a> and <a href="https://coolstar.org/">Coolstar</a>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We also need to make sure you are compatible so...
                    <br/><br/>
                    - [You will need an Intel Processor] Open up crosh with <code>Ctrl+Alt+T</code> and type <code>uname -m</code>. If it returns with <b>x86_64</b>,
                      congratulations, you're compatible. Otherwise, sorry for the bummer (but you can always dual boot into
                      Linux if you prefer that).
                    <br/>
                    - You will also need 32GB or more storage. Windows itself is a behemoth of an operating system, taking up 20GB of storage
                      with additional apps and constant updates. If you have a 16GB Chromebook, sorry you can't do it.
                    <br/>
                    Make sure to check that your Chromebook is also listed on <a href="https://coolstar.org/chromebook/windows-install.html">Coolstar</a>
                    because they have the drivers for that Chromebook. If yours is not listed there, you can't run Windows 10 due to the drivers.
                    <br/><br/>

                <h><b><u>Heads up</u></b></h>
                <h4>
                  - Doing this will void your warranty, so you won't be able to ask for repairs.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                  - You will also lose all your Chrome OS files, data and applications that are not backed up. 
                  It is highly recommended you use Google's free 100GB Google Drive storage for Chromebook owners if you have a lot of files to back up.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                - A small screwdriver (to remove a screw)
                <br/><br/>
                - Another Windows computer (to create Windows installation media).
                <br/><br/>
                - A USB flash drive of 8GB or larger (for Windows installation media).
                <br/><br/>
                - A USB mouse during Windows installation - the built-in trackpad will not work (although we will install a driver for it afterwards).

                    <br/><br/>
                    Ensure your Chromebook is completely backed up to your satisfaction.
                    <br/>
                    Turn off your Chromebook completely, until all lights are off (disconnect the charger if it is connected).
                    <br/>
                    Flip the Chromebook over, remove the screws with your screwdriver (these screws are sometimes star shaped, it can be sold in packets) 
                    until the back cover comes off. Some Chromebooks' back plate pops off easily, others you may need to use some degree of force to pry it off.
                    <br/>
                    Locate the write-protect screw and remove it. You may need to do some research to find it's location. 
                    For example, on the Acer Chromebook 14 CB3-431, it is located here:

                    Windows Only". You'll then see that none of your partitions are big enough to install Windows on. This is because

                    to do anything apart from sit patiently (again) while it "Gets ready" and "Starts services". Then there will be
                    another set up, just follow that and select your region and then you're nearly done. Once you see your brand
